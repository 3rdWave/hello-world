Just another repository

DaniÃ«l here, trying to learn basic web coding skills, starting with html, css and javascript. So far I have finished a few playlists on these subjects by 'thenewboston' on Youtube and completed the first 3 lessons in the Javascript Roadtrip on codeschool. 

I'm eager to learn more, and for that I need to practice! My first project here will be to make a chess game in the browser using html, css and javascript. I plan on learning and using node.js and vue.js to try and make the game playable online versus someone else.
